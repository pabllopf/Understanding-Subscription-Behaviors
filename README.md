# Project Instructions
A SaaS company seeks to uncover what drives its clients to renew their subscriptions. They've asked you to answer the following questions:

How many total Fintech and Crypto clients does the company have? Store as an integer variable called total_fintech_crypto_clients.
Which industry has the highest renewal rate? Store as a string variable called top_industry.
For clients that renewed their subscriptions, what was the average inflation rate when their subscriptions were renewed? Store as a float variable called average_inflation_for_renewals.
    
A SaaS company seeks to uncover what drives its clients to renew subscriptions. They’ve collected data on client details, subscription records, and economic indicators and would like to connect them to better understand its clients’ behavior. 

They’ve tasked you with analyzing these datasets to identify the key factors influencing clients’ decisions to renew their subscriptions. 

Your analysis will provide them with insights into which customers are renewing their products and the reasons behind their renewals. The company can leverage these insights to make informed decisions to increase renewal rates and improve customer loyalty, helping them stay competitive and ensure long-term growth.
